Hello!
======
Thank you for visiting! In the coming weeks and months, I'll be developing this website with an updated CV, publication list, and blog posts. My goal is to grow this site into a place where I'm able to record learning points and milestones in my journey as a Researcher with the Penn Medice BioBank.
