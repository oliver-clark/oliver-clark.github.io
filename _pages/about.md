Hello!
------
I'm an Internal Medicine resident at [Pennsylvania Hospital](https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-health-care-professionals/fellowship-and-residency-programs/pennsylvania-hospital-programs/residency-programs/pennsylvania-hospital-department-of-internal-medicine) and a researcher in genetic oncology with the [Maxwell Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/kmaxwelllab/). 

My interests lie in Hematology & Oncology, particularly in cancer screening, genetic predispositions to cancer, and immune-modulating cancer therapies. I'm currently training in Internal Medicine and studying how to improve current risk calculators for Lung Cancer, with the aim to better predict which patients should be recommended for lung cancer screening with low-dose chest CT scan.

I completed my BSc at McGill University in Biology, Computer Science, and Mathematics. I then completed my medical degree at University College Dublin in Ireland. 

In the past, I performed research at:

- [Sarah Woolley Lab](https://sarahwoolleylab.wordpress.com/) in songbird perception and production
- [BHKLab](https://www.pmgenomics.ca/bhklab/), a lab with Princess Margaret Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics
- [Systems Biology Ireland: Halasz group](https://www.ucd.ie/sbi/team/groups/halaszgroup/) studying pediatric and obstretic malignancies
