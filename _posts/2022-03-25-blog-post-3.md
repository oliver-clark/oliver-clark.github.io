In this posting, I'll review an analytical paper in Nature genetics entitled "An atlas of genetic correlations across human disease and traits", by Bulik-Sullivan et al. published 2015. It can be found [here on Nature's website](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3406) and [here on PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4797329/).

Background
------
Previously, it has been difficult to estimate genetic correlations between complex traits and diseases, using GWAS (Genome wide association studies).

This paper provides a new technique which enables estimating genetic correlations between these traits and diseases. This technique is referred to as cross-trait LD (Linkage disequilibrium) score regression.
