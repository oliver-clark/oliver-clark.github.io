In this blog post, I'll cover a paper published by Montgomery Slatkin in Nature Reviews genetics in 2008, entitled "Linkage disequilibrium - understanding the evolutionary past and mapping the medical future". It can be found on [Nature's website here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2361) and free on [Pubmed here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5124487/). 

During this review, I also consulted several youtube videos and blogs to provide more information about linkage disequilibrium (LD).
