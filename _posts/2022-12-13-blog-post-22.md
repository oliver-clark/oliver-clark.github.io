**[Genetic risk, incident gastric cancer, and healthy lifestyle: a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies and prospective cohort study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204520304605?via%3Dihub)**

This paper examines the association of genetic risk with gastric cancer, as well as connects lifestyle factors with gastric cancer risk. It then goes on to evaluate the combination lifestyle and genetic factors, and how this affects gastric cancer incidence.

Overall, this paper concludes that PRS are effective for identifying gastric cancer risk, and that lifestyle modification can substantially reduce risk of gastric cancer, 

**Methods**

This paper uses two datasets: 1) GWAS studies of Han Chinese populations in china, with approximately 10,000 cases and 10,000 controls. 2) The China Kadoorie Biobank, which includes approximately 100,000 individuals.

Using the first dataset, the team developed 5 PRS for gastric cancer. For each, they chose SNPs that were significantly associated with gastric cancer with p value equal to 5×10−4, 5×10−5, 5×10−6, 5×10−7, and 5×10−8. The PRS adjusted for age, sex, type of residential area (urban or rural), and the first ten principal components of ancestry. They controlled for LD, quality control, just as our dataset does. 

Then, the team applied these PRS to the second dataset. They compared PRS across quintiles and evaluated the impact of lifestyle on gastric cancer risk. For lifestyle, they examined the following traits available in the EHR: No current smoking, no current alcohol, low consumption of preserved foods, and frequent intake of fresh fruit and vegetables.

**Results**

For their 5 PRS with increasing strength in SNP association, they found 539, 112, 38, 18, and 12 SNPs, respectively. When applied to the second database, the PRS had the following results. p value = 5x10-5 was the most significant, although there was little difference between 4 of the 5 PRS.

When this PRS was applied to the dataset, it resulted in the following gastric cancer risk across quintiles. They also repeated this for lifestyle factors.

They then combined risk across PRS and lifestyle factors:
