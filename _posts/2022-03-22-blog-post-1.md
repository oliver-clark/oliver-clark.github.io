Welcome to the blog. In this first posting, I aim to describe the Penn Medicine Biobank. Although it remains an unfamiliar resource within Penn Medicine, it contains a fantastic array of electronic health record and genetic information with tremendous research potential.

Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB)
------
Firstly, PMBB has a great website [here](https://pmbb.med.upenn.edu/) which describes the database in much better detail than I can do it justice. Put simply, the database contains, as of 2022:
-60,232 patients mapped to 10,011 ICD-9 codes
-21,790 who have been genotyped so far

Interestingly, PMBB is not unique. There exist several other databases that serve similar functions, such as the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) and the [Millilon Veterans Program](https://www.mvp.va.gov/pwa/).

The exciting potential in PMBB is based on the ability to link phenotypic and genotypic data in a large scale.

Why this database?
------
During medical school, I developed an obsession with watching medical grand rounds lectures throughout the US, frequently available on Youtube. Along this path, I watched a fascinating lecture by Dr. Daniel Rader on the PMBB and its applications to lipid physiology in the field of Cardiology. His medical grand rounds in November 2020 to Vanderbilt audience is available on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5fkmKkKgw). Other lectures by Dr. Daniel Rader are available from grand rounds and UW in 2015 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_f4Wpa6x3M) and a lecture to Northwestern in 2019 [here](https://imswebcast.feinberg.northwestern.edu/Mediasite/Play/9ad2f0d2854147ffad652a84bf38fed51d?catalog=0e6612ac3c7c4e80843f670d0adb7b6821)
