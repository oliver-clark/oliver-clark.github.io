In the upcoming days, I'm going to review background literature on the topic of my future research. Today, I'm going to evaluate a paper published in June 2017 in Nature Genetics Entitled "Large-scale association analysis identifies new lung cancer susceptibility loci and heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility across histological subtypes". It can be accessed at [this link](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3892)
