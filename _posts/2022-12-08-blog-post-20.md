Today I reviewed a number of papers on PRS literature. In order of less-well-known to more-well-known...

1. [Polygenic risk scores to stratify cancer screening should predict mortality not incidence
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9151796/)

The message of this paper is in the title. They note that PRS normally measure cancer incidence, which is not always the same as mortality. If PRS do not discriminate lethal from non-lethal disease, using them to determine who to subject to a screening strategy associated with overdiagnosis is unlikely to be of benefit. If we evaluaute PRS based on mortality, we are more likely to develop clinically relevant guidance.

2. [Assessing thyroid cancer risk using polygenic risk scores](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7084156/)

A PRS model using 10 SNPs associated with papillary thyroid disease was noted to be better than a control model using only clinical factors. It was also better than a model that included additional SNPs. It concluded that PRSs based on a small number of common germline variants is better for papillary thyroid cancer. Outcomes were change in AUC and risk in top decile compared to bottom decile.

3. [Will polygenic risk scores for cancer ever be clinically useful?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8139954/)

Title sparking controversy. For PRS to be clinically useful, two assertions must be proven correct. The first assertion is that PRSs provides sufficient risk discrimination. The second is that this risk discrimination is meaningful in the context of absolute risk of that cancer and applicable in the context of respective tools available for prevention and early detection.

Two commonly presented measures of discrimination derived from these distributions are: (i) comparison of the RR for those at the top and bottom tails of the PRS distribution (ii) comparison for specified PRS cut-offs of the proportion of affected individuals with ‘positive’ PRS (‘detection rate’) versus the proportion of unaffected individuals falling within the same PRS score range (the ‘false-positive rate’ (1–specificity)) (Supplementary Fig. 1). For the common cancers, PRS for prostate currently leads on discriminatory performance, with RR of 14.54 between the top 5% and bottom 5% of men. This translates to a false-positive rate of 5% for a detection rate of 16%. Or, to achieve a detection rate of 50%, tolerance of a false-positive rate of 25%.

They present a figure which is helpful in understanding how to translate outcomes in PRS to clinically meaningful difference in risk.
