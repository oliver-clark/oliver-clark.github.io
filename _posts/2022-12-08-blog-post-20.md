Today I reviewed a number of papers on PRS literature. In order of less-well-known to more-well-known...

1. [Polygenic risk scores to stratify cancer screening should predict mortality not incidence
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9151796/)

The message of this paper is in the title. They note that PRS normally measure cancer incidence, which is not always the same as mortality. If PRS do not discriminate lethal from non-lethal disease, using them to determine who to subject to a screening strategy associated with overdiagnosis is unlikely to be of benefit. If we evaluaute PRS based on mortality, we are more likely to develop clinically relevant guidance.

2. [Assessing thyroid cancer risk using polygenic risk scores](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7084156/)

A PRS model using 10 SNPs associated with papillary thyroid disease was noted to be better than a control model using only clinical factors. It was also better than a model that included additional SNPs. It concluded that PRSs based on a small number of common germline variants is better for papillary thyroid cancer. Outcomes were change in AUC and risk in top decile compared to bottom decile.

3. [Will polygenic risk scores for cancer ever be clinically useful?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8139954/)

Title sparking controversy. For PRS to be clinically useful, two assertions must be proven correct. The first assertion is that PRSs provides sufficient risk discrimination. The second is that this risk discrimination is meaningful in the context of absolute risk of that cancer and applicable in the context of respective tools available for prevention and early detection.

Two commonly presented measures of discrimination derived from these distributions are: (i) comparison of the RR for those at the top and bottom tails of the PRS distribution (ii) comparison for specified PRS cut-offs of the proportion of affected individuals with ‘positive’ PRS (‘detection rate’) versus the proportion of unaffected individuals falling within the same PRS score range (the ‘false-positive rate’ (1–specificity)) (Supplementary Fig. 1). For the common cancers, PRS for prostate currently leads on discriminatory performance, with RR of 14.54 between the top 5% and bottom 5% of men. This translates to a false-positive rate of 5% for a detection rate of 16%. Or, to achieve a detection rate of 50%, tolerance of a false-positive rate of 25%.

They present a figure which is helpful in understanding how to translate outcomes in PRS to clinically meaningful difference in risk.

They also note that the figure above, and for many PRS, we are discussing relative risk, but not taking into consideration absolute risk. When applying results in someone's risk to whether they should be screened, the only important factor should ultimately be absolute risk. E.g. it doesn't matter if someone is in the top centile for risk of adrenal cancer - because if that represents 0.01% absolute risk, screening still isn't warranted.

4. [Genome-wide association studies and polygenic risk scores for skin cancer: clinically useful yet?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6761051/)

PRS for melanoma show roughly 2-to-3-fold increases in risk and modest improvements in risk prediction (2–7% increases). PRS are associated with 2-fold and 3-fold increases in risk of cSCC and BCC, respectively, with small improvements (2% increase) in predictive ability. Therefore, existing data indicate that PRS may offer small, but potentially meaningful, improvements to risk prediction

5. [Evaluating Polygenic Risk Scores for Breast Cancer in Women of African Ancestry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8418423/)

The PRSs stratify breast cancer risk in women of African ancestry, with attenuated performance compared with that reported in European, Asian, and Latina populations. The PRS had odds ratio 1.27 and AUC 0.571, which are pretty bad and even worse than EUR ancestry. Future work is needed to improve breast risk stratification for women of African ancestry.
